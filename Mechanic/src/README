Mechanic - On-Board Diagnosis Using Arduino 

...

Installation is easy: Just get the latest release from the
downloads page and place the contents of the "src" directory in a
"Railuino" directory under your Arduino "libraries" directory.
Then restart Arduino. You should now see a bunch of new examples
that teach you how to use Railuino. The "Misc/Tests" example is
a good way of validating your setup.

For documentation on the functions I currently recommend to read
the comments in the "Railuino.h" header file. There are also
several sets of slides on the downloads page that describe the
overall approach and the hardware. Finally, there is a video from
LinuxTag and another one from DroidCon NL on YouTube.

The library itself is made available under the GNU Lesser General
Public License (LGPL). See the LICENSE file for details. All
examples except the test suite are licensed under the Creative
Commons Zero license, which effectively makes them public domain.
The test suite is also licensed under the LGPL.

Railuino uses parts of this library, which is very much
recommended:

- The CAN controller code is based on Fabian Greif's CANlib,
  which is (c) 2007-2012 Fabian Greif and licensed under a
  BSD-style license.

Have fun!
