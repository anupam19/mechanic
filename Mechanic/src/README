This library allows you to query some diagnostic values from your car
using an Arduino and a CAN shield (I, of course, recommend the CANdiy
shield from Watterott, but Sparkfun's or Seed Studio's should also work
just fine). It assumes your car provides an OBD-II port that supports the
CAN bus (which should be true for most vehicles, since it has been a
standard since 2008).

Mechanic works fine with the following Arduino boards:

- Diecimila               (some sketches too big for ATmega168)
- Duemilanove             (some sketches too big for ATmega168)
- Uno
- Leonardo                (CANdiy shield only)
- Mega 1280 und Mega 2560 (CANdiy shield only)

Installation is easy: Just get the latest release from the downloads page
and place its contents into a "Mechanic" directory under your Arduino
"libraries" directory. Then restart Arduino. You should now see a bunch of
new examples that teach you how to use Mechanic. The "Misc/SelfTest"
example is a good way of validating your setup (unless your Arduino has an
ATmega168, which doesn't have enough RAM for the sketch).

The repository also contains a small Android app that shows a live
dashboard with some values transmitted from Arduino via Bluetooth. I use
an inexpensive Bluetooth board from MiB Instruments (check eBay), but,
again, there is no reason why others shouldn't work just as well assuming
they provide a serial interface for communicating with the
microcontroller.

For documentation on the functions I currently recommend to read the
comments in the "Mechanic.h" header file. There is also an article in
German c't Hardware Hacks magazine 2/2013.

The library itself is made available under the GNU Lesser General Public
License (LGPL). See the LICENSE file for details. All examples except the
test suite are licensed under the Creative Commons Zero license, which
effectively makes them public domain. The test suite sketch is licensed
under the LGPL.

Railuino uses parts of a CAN library, which is (c) 2007 Fabian Greif and
published under a BSD-style license.

Have fun!
